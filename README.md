Working through Basketball Data Science using py_ball and Python

## Agenda

My goal is to work through the book [Basketball Data Science with Applications in R](https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Data-Science-Applications-Chapman/dp/1138600814) (BDS) by Zuccolotto and Manisera. The twist is that this repository will leverage [py_ball](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/py_ball) to source all of the data and the analysis will be done in Python. The hope is that this effort will expose a wider audience to the work presented in BDS and the available data. This repository will work through the following chapters:

* [Chapter 2: Data and Basic Statistical Analyses](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/tree/master/Chapter%202)
  - [Pace and Ratings](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%202/Pace%20and%20Ratings.ipynb)
  - [Inequality Analysis](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%202/Inequality%20Analysis.ipynb)
  - [Shot Charts](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%202/Shot%20Charts.ipynb)
* [Chapter 3: Discovering Patterns in Data](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%203)
  - [Assist Networks](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%203/Assist%20Networks.ipynb)
* Chapter 4: Finding Groups in Data
* Chapter 5: Modeling Relationships in Data

Each chapter is decently long, so there may be multiple Jupyter notebooks per chapter, depending on how things shake out.
